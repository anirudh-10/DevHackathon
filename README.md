# DevHackathon
Setup ->
Download all files in a folder and run camcapture.html in a web browser.
Description ->
This app is effectively the eyes of a visually impaired person. 
This app helps a person to partially remove his dependency on other to read something.
Our app uses ocr, text to speech and camweb facilities available to us.
This app clicks image of a text using webcam and then after processing(ocr) speaks the text written on the image.
Disfunction ->
Camweb was not connected to our ocr api so we have to edit generate a link to the photo to access our audio.
